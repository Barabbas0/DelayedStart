# DelayedStart
+ Basic script to wait a set amount of time before executing a program.
+ Created because Windows will only let you enable or disable startup programs, rather than allowing a delayed or staggered start.

#### Usage:

DelayedStart.bat "Program you want to execute" "How long to wait in seconds"
